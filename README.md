Steps to run into your device:
1. Dawnload ZIP file of the source code.
2. Set up your device for react-native
  - install node.js
  - install jdk
  - set path variable
  - if required, dawnload & install android studio to set up SDK
 -Note: Almost your setup is done, I have just given you a brief idea, kindly follow react-native documentation if case of any issue.
  
3. If set up is done try some commands on your CLI
- npm adb devices (firstly connect your phone with your laptop through data-cable)
- npx react-native run-android 

All set, now you are good to go !

In case of any trouble, feel free to ask me :)
